# Minecraft Server powered by Docker & Azure Container Instance
This repo deploys [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server) as [Azure Container Instance](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/), using Terraform.

## Instructions
There are 2 ways to set this up:

### Codespace setup
The easiest method is to use a GitHub [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (in beta). Just create a GitHub Codespace from the Code menu. Wait for the Codespace to complete provisioning. When the Codespace has completed provisioning and you open a terminal window (Ctrl-`, Control-backquote), you should see a message like this:
```
To provision infrastructure, make sure you're logged in with Azure CLI e.g. run 'az login' and 'az account set --subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'. Then, either:
 - change to the /home/codespace/workspace/azure-minecraft-docker/terraform directory and run 'terraform apply', or:
 - run /home/codespace/workspace/azure-minecraft-docker/scripts/deploy.ps1 -apply
To destroy infrastructure, replace 'apply' with 'destroy' in above commands
```
Just follow these steps to provision Minecraft on Azure.
### Local setup
If you set this up locally, make sure you have the following pre-requisites:
- [Azure CLI](http://aka.ms/azure-cli)
- [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (to get that you can use [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) on Linux & macOS, [Homebrew](https://github.com/hashicorp/homebrew-tap) on macOS or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/terraform) on Windows)

On macOS, you can run `brew bundle` to install the pre-requisites.

Once you have those, you can go ahead and provision:
- Use Azure CLI for SSO with [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/azure_cli): `az login`
- Select subscription to use: `az account set --subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
- Initialize terraform: `terraform init`
- Provision cloud infrastructure: `terraform apply`

### Customization
You can customize the deployment by overriding defaults for Terraform [input variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html). The easiest way to do this is to copy [config.auto.tfvars.example](./terraform/config.auto.tfvars.example) and save it as config.auto.tfvars.
- Use the `minecraft_users` array to define users allowed to log in
- Use a custom DNS name with `vanity_dns_zone_id` and `vanity_hostname_prefix`, using an Azure DNS managed domain
- Once things get serious, you may want to start backing up data with `enable_backup`
- Are your kids home schooling on the same computer that has Minecraft installed? Configure auto shutdown & startup during weekdays with `enable_auto_startstop`, `start_time` & `stop_time`. The Logic App triggers created can be favorited in the [mobile app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/mobile-app/) for on-demand startup & shutdown.
- Concerned about chat messages appearing in logs? `enable_log_filter` uses the [Console Spam Fix](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/console-spam-fix) and [configures](./minecraft/log-filter/config.yml) it to hide chat messages from logs. This feature is dependent on [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) and is more brittle in automation, but satisfies a key privacy requirement.

See [variables.tf](./terraform/variables.tf) for all input variables.
## Dashboard
Once provisioned, a dashboard like this will be available in the Azure Portal:

You can update the dashboard in the portal and re-generate the [template](./terraform/dashboard.tpl) using [templatize_dashboard.ps1](./scripts/templatize_dashboard.ps1).
